//MEDIA QUERY MANAGER

/*
    Writing media querys as mixins makes you write less code, and if you have to change breakpoints
    it's bette to change only one mixin than all of your files
*/

/*

0 - 600px => Phone

600px - 900px => Tablet portrait

900px - 1200px => Tablet landscape

1200px - 1800px => NORMAL STYLES

1800 + => Big screens

*/

    @media (max-width: 600px) { @content };
} //@content allows you to add any content you want to the mixin

//There is an even better way to do it

/*
    $breakpoint argument choices:

    - phone
    - tab-port
    - tab-land
    - big-desktop

*/

/*
    OBS:

    The max-width 600px query applies to all devices tha have width inferior to 600px,
    but The max-width 900px query applies to all devices tha have width inferior to 900px,
    INCLUDING THE 600px OR LESS DEVICE.

    THATS WHY YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH THE ORDER OF MEDIA QUERIES:

    The first one should be the larger and the last the smaller, in desktop first applications,
    and the other way around in mobile first applications

/*
    In media queries, we should use a unit that is affected by changes in the default font-size.
    It's better for responsive purposes.

    In media queries both rem and em are not affect by the font-size set in the html tag, but by
    the font-size of the browser, so they are the same.

    As rems fail to work in some browsers, the best option is to use ems to define media queries

    1em = 16px (default font size of the browser)
